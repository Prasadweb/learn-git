management activities facilitate the management of various sectoral assets, tracking of their age, location, usage
duration, maintenance history, preventive maintenance plan, O&M Budgeting, and a range of other variables. This helps
a lot in understanding the existing capacity of assets to deal with the need in the respective sector.</p>
