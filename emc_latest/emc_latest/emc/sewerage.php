							<!--<h3>Sewerage</h3>-->
							<p>The unavailability of adequate facilities for the collection, treatment, and disposal of sewage leads to the mixing of
sewage in water bodies leading to environmental & public health hazards. Properly managed sewage collection,
treatment, and disposal facilities are the need of the hour.</p>


							<p>We have provided engineering and project management consultancy services for sewerage projects consisting of more
than 600 km of sewer network, 3 STPs of 100 MLD Capacity, and 56 sewage pumping stations. We have acquired expertise
in mitigating various dificult conditions like narrow streets, high groundwater tables, collapsible soil, etc. through
advanced technological interventions such as trenchless technology, SBH shoring, and well point dewatering, etc.
during the implementation of sewerage projects.</p>
