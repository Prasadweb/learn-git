							<h2>Construction sector</h2>
							<p>The construction industry produces a wide range of products, and the enterprises are 
								equally diverse. However, the vast majority of enterprises involved in on-site 
								construction are small and local. Despite globalization and the existence of an
								international construction industry, the majority of construction activity is 
								still undertaken by local firms. There is a tendency among enterprises in 
								construction (as in other industries) to outsource the supply of goods and 
								services required in the production process. Building materials, plant and 
								equipment are generally purchased or hired from other enterprises. Specialized 
								services are supplied by subcontractors, and labour by labour agents. Design 
								and engineering services are also provided by separate professional entities.
