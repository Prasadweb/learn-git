							<h3>IT Solutions</h3>
							<p>Infrastructure projects in sectors like water supply, sewerage, drainage, etc. have a great impact on the development of
society and its economy. Inefficient progress monitoring and data management in projects under these sectors result in a
delay in the progress of our society and your business. The use of Information Technology in these sectors will result in
proper data management, quality improvement, and timely completion of projects. However, we have observed that
the use of IT in the sectors like water supply, sewerage, drainage, etc. is not adequate in today's times.</p>


							<p>We at EcoMetrix, have a group of IT experts who have been working on the integration of information technology with the
survey, planning, construction management, O&M, etc. of infrastructure projects.</p>
